# Linear-Regression-From-Scratch
Linear regression built from scratch using NumPy and Pandas to understand the ML workflow. Applied to housing price prediction as a practical use case.


**Overview**

Implemented a linear regression model using only NumPy and Pandas to understand the ML workflow.

**Objective**

Predict housing prices using numerical features, with exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and patterns before modelling.
